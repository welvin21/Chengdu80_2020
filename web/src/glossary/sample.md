**[Stochastic oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp)**
A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time.

**[Ultimate Oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ultimateoscillator.asp)**
The Ultimate Oscillator is a range-bound indicator with a value that fluctuates between 0 and 100. Similar to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), levels below 30 are deemed to be oversold, and levels above 70 are deemed to be overbought.

**[Moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp)**
In finance, a moving average (MA) is a stock indicator that is commonly used in technical analysis. The reason for calculating the moving average of a stock is to help smooth out the price data by creating a constantly updated average price.

**[Exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp)**
An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.

**[Slow exponential moving average]()**
26 day exponentially weighted moving average.

**[Fast exponential moving average]()**
12 day exponentially weighted moving average.

**[Bollinger Bands](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/bollinger-bands)**
Bollinger Bands are a type of price envelope developed by John Bollinger
(Price envelopes define upper and lower price range levels.) Bollinger Bands are envelopes plotted at a standard deviation level above and below a simple moving average of the price. Because the distance of the bands is based on standard deviation, they adjust to volatility swings in the underlying price.

**[MACD](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp)**
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price.

**[Arima Model](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/arima-model-time-series-forecasting-python/#:~:text=So%20what%20exactly%20is%20an,used%20to%20forecast%20future%20values)**
In statistics and econometrics, and in particular in time series analysis, an autoregressive integrated moving average model is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average model. Both of these models are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series.

**[Pearson correlation coeffecient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)**
the Pearson correlation coefficient, also referred to as Pearson's r, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, or the bivariate correlation, is a statistic that measures linear correlation between two variables X and Y. It has a value between +1 and −1.

**[Kendall-tau correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient)**
the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, commonly referred to as Kendall's τ coefficient, is a statistic used to measure the ordinal association between two measured quantities. A τ test is a non-parametric hypothesis test for statistical dependence based on the τ coefficient.

**[Spearman correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)**
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Spearman's ρ, named after Charles Spearman and often denoted by the Greek letter or as, is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation. It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.
